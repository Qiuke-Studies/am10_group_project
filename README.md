Some dataset ideas:

-   <https://stats.oecd.org/>

-   <https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/>

-   <https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/>

## Deliverables

1.  **Your final group presentation** which you should upload on canvas

2.  **A github repo**: Theis should be organized as an RStudio project, and should be added to the class table on <https://github.com/kostis-christodoulou/am10.mam2023> (done)

3.  Create a new public repo for your final group project and initialize it with a "readme" file. (done)

4.  Edit the readme.md file to be a short, one-page description of what your final project is about. Add the data sources and question/issue you want to address

5.  Organize your work under an **R Markdown** to introduce, frame, and describe your story and findings.

6.  Commit and push your work as you go along; the more commits, the merrier.

7.  At the end of your project, I should be able to clone the repo locally and reproduce all your work, visualisations, etc.

## Presentation Deliverables

-   A statement of the question or purpose. What problems or questions did you set out to analyse? What were the key issues raised?

-   The background and preparation for conducting the project. How did you prepare for the project? What sources or background readings did you consult? What information did you use in developing your ideas from the conceptual stage to the finished project?

-   Methodology. What did you do, and how did you do it? What statistical techniques did you use --- for instance, scatterplots, correlation, confidence intervals, linear/logistic regression?

-   Results and conclusions. This is where you summarise and present your data analyses and communicate your main results. What did you find out? This might include tables, graphs, or verbal summaries. What did you learn about the problem or question you set out to investigate?

-   Discussion and critique. What did you learn about the process of carrying out your project? What went wrong, and how could you improve it next time? For instance, did any sources of bias creep into your survey or experiment? What advice would you give future students?
